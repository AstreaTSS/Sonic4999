Hi! I'm just a random person on here. I'm far from being the most skilled at programming, but I make a bunch of stuff in Python. It's mostly just Discord bots, but sometimes I expand out a bit and dip my toes into other places, too.

My main project as of right now is [Seraphim](https://github.com/Sonic4999/Seraphim-Bot), and it really should be no surprise. It's my multi-purpose bot that is meant to do what other bots do not or fail to do. I'll admit that while it is public, it also isn't being advertised everywhere as I do not have the money for a host to keep it running if it expands beyond a certain point. I guess that's how life is.

Feel free to take a look around. If you need to contact me, I'd prefer Discord (Sonic49#7171), but I also do have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SonicTBM) that I check from time to time. Otherwise, enjoy.
